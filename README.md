# Java-Hotel-Reservations-and-Reporting

This Java project, completed as part of my MSc in Computer Science and AI, consists of two main components: a Hotel Management system and a Quarterly Sales Reporting system. Each component is designed to handle specific operations related to hotel reservations and sales reporting for different departments.

## Project Overview

### Hotel Management System

The Hotel Management system allows users to make reservations, search for reservations by last name, sort reservations, check room availability, and calculate income generated by room class. It supports different types of rooms (Standard, Deluxe, Superior) with various features and pricing.

### Quarterly Sales Reporting System

The Quarterly Sales Reporting system helps manage and report sales data for different departments: Electrical, Kitchen, Bathroom, Soft Furnishings, and Accessories. It calculates total sales, estimates tax, and sets sales targets for the next quarter.

## Features

### Hotel Management System

- Reserve single or multiple rooms.
- Search for reservations by last name.
- Sort reservations alphabetically by last name.
- Check room availability by room type.
- Calculate and display income generated per room class.

### Quarterly Sales Reporting System

- Enter monthly sales data for each department.
- Calculate total quarterly sales for each department.
- Calculate and display total sales tax for the quarter.
- Set and display sales targets for the next quarter.

## Project Structure

- `Quarterly_Report.java`: Contains the implementation of the Quarterly Sales Reporting system.
